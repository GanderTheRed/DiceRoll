- (Optional) Replace the simple 6 sided die with a 12 sided die [No marks]
- (Optional) Sum and accumulate the value of every dice that is rolled while the application is running [No marks]

# Class Level Variables (Fields):

- Random rnd
- int intDie1
- int intDie2
- int intDie3
- int intDiceCorrectScore
- int intDiceIncorrectScore

Your application should use a ComboBox to guess the number that will be rolled.

To give you a better understanding of what some of the variables do:

- intDie1 will represent the number that was rolled for the first Die.
- intDie2 and intDie3 will represent the number that was rolled for the second and third dice respectively.
- intDiceCorrectScore and intDiceIncorrectScore are integer variables used to keep track of the users guess from the dice combobox
- If the guessed number was rolled, you would increment the intDiceCorrectScore


Once complete the application should look similar to this:

## Hand-In
Please download the finished code from Github and upload it to Blackboard before the due date.

 
## Expectations
This assignment should be completed individually, please ask your instructor for clarification where needed.  Receiving help or feedback from classmates is okay, but do not share or copy any materials that will be added to the assignment submission.  Help your classmates learn to program but, do not share code/files.  Any code that you find on the internet can be referenced in comments, where necessary.
